Hey everyone, my name is Ayo and I am an undergraduate student studying statistics. 
I'm interested in data analytics and marketing. Currently, I am working on building projects and a portfolio where I can showcase my analytics skills. 
Regarding tools, I'm learning Python while advancing my skill in R, SQL, Excel, and Tableau.
